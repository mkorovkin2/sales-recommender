In 9.2 release cycle, performance was a focus. Co-authored PostgreSQL's group commit implementation. Responsible for large improvements in the performance of in-memory sorting. Co-authored the contrib module pg_stat_statements. Also responsible for considerable reductions in electricity consumption of Postgres while idle.

Devised scheme to improve commit_delay, and thereby make group commit more effective for the 9.3 release.

In 9.4 release cycle, contributed to additional improvements in query instrumentation. Also contributed to initial development of jsonb semi-structured, indexable datatype.

In 9.5 release cycle, contributed INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE/DO NOTHING (""UPSERT"") feature as its primary author. This feature was previously considered by many to be the most requested feature for PostgreSQL. Also created new, extensible infrastructure for accelerating sorting, ""abbreviated keys"". This accelerated sorting of tuples (based on a text column or a numeric column) by a little over an order of magnitude in some cases, and more typically by 3x to 5x. I contributed the text encoding scheme itself (a client of this extensible infrastructure), while another contributor worked on the numeric encoding scheme.

Followed up with improvements to external sorting in 9.6 and 10 release. PostgreSQL 10 was also the release that the amcheck corruption detection module first appeared in, a module which I contributed.

Heavily involved in code review and bug fixes. Occasionally involved in conference organizing and other advocacy activities.

It's only when I started working at small start-up marketing firm that I decided to push myself out of my comfort zone in order to take on responsibility by leading a team. I found that, naturally, I really wanted to help and develop others in the same way that my mentors had helped develop myself.

Ever since moving to New York, I've wanted to help young entrepreneurs by putting in the time to train and mentor them myself. As the CEO of the company, I feel it is my duty to give insight and feedback to help someone accelerate.

Being a mentor as a CEO is just one of the responsibilities that I take on. I also work to ensure my client's needs are properly met by increasing marketshare, revenue, and brand awareness through customer acquisition through a variety of mediums involving direct marketing techniques. Due to the demand of my clients, I'm working on expanding the company to 50 different markets by the end of 2018, both internationally and domestically.

My goal is to continue providing excellent service to my clients as well as the employees within my company.

Was part of the team that built a tool for Exploratory Data Analysis, built on top of the Azure Cloud Infrastructure, connecting users to raw data at its source and helping them easily extract insights.
The tool replaced large Splunk installations at Microsoft. It spread virally throughout Microsoft, growing to 10K+ users (roughly 10% of Microsoft). Customers included teams in Azure, Windows, Office, Xbox and PowerBI. The tool also grew in popularity in non-product organizations like the marketing, global business and support. Parts of the tool were productized externally as “Application Insights App Analytics” and “Log Analytics” on the Azure portal.

- Users could focus on understanding the data and extracting insights first, before worrying about which tools to use to convince others. The tool made data exploration easy, with almost no learning curve, allowing you to get started in minutes.

- It was a powerful tool for teams, easily scaling to hundreds and thousands of users. Teams could use the tool to manage metadata on their data assets and easily discover them for their analysis. The tool could figure out groups of collaborators and surface relevant assets the team is working on.

- The tool combines data discovery, processing, exploration, and visualization all in one integrated, personalized experience.

This project was short yet very intensive. My team was working on building specialized infrastructure tools used in automated testing for a major networking appliances company. Our tools were used to deploy and configure custom Linux distribution on a specialized hardware over network.
Features:
- scripting using Python 2.7
- development and testing on remote CentOS 5 machines
- strict reviewing process
- PEP8 compliance, highly documented code
- unit tests with minimum 90% code coverage
- setting up complete PXE environment using dnsmasq
- remote hardware control over ssh/telnet
- extensible logging
Responsibilities:
- design and architecture
- responsible for creating major pats of code
- communication with customers

Project #2, working as a remote vendor at Microsoft.
Our team (alongside with developers from Microsoft) was responsible for Microsoft Dynamics CRM modernization. There were many places in web application that heavily relied on IE-only features and hacks. Those places were refactored to be crossbrowser.
Features:
- direct communication with Microsoft developers
- strict reviewing process
- heavy UI and unit test automation.

Other projects:
I also worked on several SharePoint projects(both for 2007 and 2010 SharePoint), and took part in development of several internal web projects for Akvelon.

Lyft, Internal Tools Team
April, 2016—November, 2018

For two years I was the sole owner of Lyft's Tier-0 geospatial service. The service is responsible for core regional configuration such as where Lyft is available and what rides cost. It was the second highest traffic service at Lyft until I added a cache layer. With the cache, the service/client now easily handles 100 million geospatial queries per minute. I also reduced average P99 response time from 150ms to 5ms.

I designed and implemented the payments infrastructure used to pay bonuses to drivers. The system has now processed tens of millions of dollars. The system uses anomaly detection to automatically flag questionable bonuses and present them for review in an Angular front end.

Lyft, Data Platform Team
July, 2015—April, 2016

The Data Platform team is responsible for Lyft's realtime and batch ETL systems, collecting and structuring terabytes of event data daily.

I designed and implemented the tool used to batch edit and backfill event stream data. By parallelizing the job and using a consumer/producer pattern, it streams data from/to our DB at 10k events per second.

I massively reduced load on Redshift by moving large ETL jobs to Hive and by dynamically shifting resources between analysts and ETL jobs based on current need.

It was definitely a rollercoaster worth riding and I highly recommend it to anyone who really wants to push themselves up to the next level.

I was able to create beautiful projects within a week, each of them consisting of different languages and frameworks such as Vanilla JS, Django, and React. The main experience was being able to tackle troubleshooting issues from all angles such as the command line, or the console, or getting into the shell to manipulate data to see why the app is reacting in a certain way.

The project that I'm most proud of is All Ways, where all you have to do is plug in your destination and the app will direct you to the nearest BART station, let you know what station to get off at, and how to get to your destination from there. Another one titled RaceChart was very data heavy visualizer.

3451,2914,2914,mdemmitt,Lyft,San Francisco Bay Area,"In my time at Lyft the engineering organization grew from 30 to 160 members, and weekly rides grew by 5x. I started as an individual contributor on the API Platform team, and then took over management as the team grew. The API Platform team had two goals:
1. scale the back-end monolithic php API to meet user demand
2. architect the decomposition of the php API into python micro services.

Engineering highlights:
▪ Planned and executed sharding of our MongoDB datastore, which improved the stability and reliability of Lyft’s core service
▪ Implemented an SQS-backed queue/consumer service written in python (using gevent). The service was used to enqueue large batches (tens of millions) of callbacks in SQS and fire those callbacks at the right time, to the right service. The service was used for tasks like running data migrations across millions of users.
▪ Created a DynamoDB-backed eventually-consistent python service to handle service discovery. This service was designed as a replacement for Lyft’s use of etcd.
▪ Refactored application code to remove table-scan queries and their associated indexes.This resulted in more efficient memory use in MongoDB, reduced query times, a simpler query mix, and eliminated the risk of a run-away table scan degrading production performance.

Leadership highlights:
I played an integral part in shaping Lyft’s interview processes for all engineering levels. When I first joined, candidate interviews were ad-hoc and did not have any particular focus. I worked with the CTO and VP of Engineering to introduce the practice of assigning a subject-focus and agenda for each of a candidate’s interviews. As a result, the interviewers got a more detailed picture of each interviewee. As Lyft began hiring engineering managers and directors for its growing engineering organization, I set the categories for our management interviews, and I coached interviewers on what questions to ask for each interview category.

3505,2968,2968,anderson-reinkordt-34b52420,Freelance,Lincoln,"A couple of years ago, my good friend Matt Alexander suggested learning Ruby on Rails. Years of experience with shell scripting, web technologies and problem-solving brought me so far, but I had little understanding of the larger framework that makes up any web application. Rails was exactly what I needed.

I immediately began work to rebuild a website for Prairie Hill Learning Center (http://www.prairiehill.com). My initial desire to rebuild the site was two-fold; I find Wordpress cumbersome to use and I wanted to build an application for volunteer sign-up at the Children's Country Fair (an annual Prairie Hill event for families to visit and have fun with outdoor activities like pony-riding and obstacle courses). Taking this on as my first big application proved to be the best challenge I could get. The site has undergone a few refinements as I understood more of what I was doing while building every other application I was inspired to create (audio logs, blogs, developer forums, video uploaders, schedulers, etc) and the volunteer sign-up application successfully allowed us to forgo the massive google docs spreadsheet (containing all sorts of information not applicable to the individual volunteer) we had been using previous.

As a result of this experience, I decided to begin freelance work in the summer of 2014, building sites and applications for local non-profits, realtors, helicopter pilots, tattooers, game developers and my own creative and useful fancy, as well as helping to solve problems with existing sites. It's what I love to do!

Also currently building in Angular2!

I lead a diverse team of talented engineers focused on tackling complex challenges in the ever-evolving landscape of fraud. As a team, we:

- Enhance our ML pipeline to streamline building new model features, experimenting with new algorithms, and productionizing new models to combat new fraud vectors
- Continuously iterate on our real-time Decision Engine to allow non-engineers to quickly test new hypotheses and react to new attacks in real time
- Create intuitive product challenges for flagged users, built with good users in mind to reduce the impact of false positives
- Collaborate closely with other internal product teams to build towards a product abuse fighting platform that can be leveraged for a multitude of product vulnerabilities, and to scale our ability to react to attacks on new product lines.

– writing libraries for common microservice functionality like logging, config management and metrics;

– provisioning and configuring AWS EC2 instances with supervisord, Papertrail logging, security groups and IAM roles;

– creating CI workflows over multiple environments using Codeship and AWS CodeDeploy;

– writing libraries to separate interfaces (queues, caches, SQL DBs) from implementations (RabbitMQ, Redis, Postgres) to ease onsite deployments and potentially switch to lower-cost, platform-specific implementations (Google PubSub or AWS DynamoDB) in the future for our cloud product;

– firefighting and fixing critical bugs (and, occasionally, less critical bugs) in all of the above.

• Leading the technical design, implementation, and production readiness for Service Identity, a key component in enabling service‐to‐service authentication for thousands of Twitter’s micro-services. Prior to my departure, it was considered one of the most important projects on Platform Engineering.
• Contributing in the design and development of Chargeback, a service that allowed resource usage metering of physical servers and multi‐tenant services (Mesos / Aurora, Storage, Hadoop, etc.) on a per cost‐center, per‐team basis, with a unified pricing model and pricing methodologies similar to public clouds. It lead to company‐wide infrastructure efficiency and optimization programs.
• Cross‐team collaborations with Technical Project Managers, Software Engineers, and Product Managers on the Twitter CA (secrets and certificate authorization), Roster (team and department hierarchy) and various other Infrastructure teams to drive initiatives and design in service‐to‐service authentication.
• Participating and aiding in team-level quarterly OKR setting.
• Working in a distributed team; myself working a year remotely from Canada during my second year of tenure, after a year of working in the SF HQ.
• Acting as a technical speaker at Twitter’s Compute Event on Chargeback for Multi‐tenant Infrastructure, with approximately 200 attendees.
• Traveling to conferences such as Mesosphere and Container World to be a technical ambassador of our products.
• Conducting over the phone and onsite interviews for potential engineering candidates at various seniority levels.

Over time I helped lead efforts to move off of that tech stack and onto a more modern approach using React, Redux, and Webpack. Along the way I used a wide variety of JavaScript libraries, UI frameworks, build tools, and testing frameworks (both unit testing and automated integration testing).

Initially I was hired in at the Senior level, but was quickly promoted to Staff, then on to Senior Staff. In addition to my responsibilities as an individual contributor I led our internal cross team initiative known as the Web Discipline where all web developers in Climate were invited to join biweekly to discuss new trends in web development, set goals regarding technical debt, and share solutions to common problems. I also helped drive technology and architecture decisions for web products across teams.

Some of my favorite tasks at Climate involved working on mapping and geospatial components. This allowed me to become familiar with LeafletJS, Turf, and related libraries.

Development: JavaScript (React, Flux, Redux, ES6, Babel, Backbone, jQuery, Underscore / LoDash, Handlebars, Webpack, Browserify, RequireJS), Bootstrap, Less, and limited work with Ruby

5849,5314,5314,jcornwell,Limelight Networks,"Seattle, WA","Started as an early, key member of a Seattle internet start-up, Delve Networks, that was then acquired by Limelight Networks. Played a leading role in the software development of user facing pieces of the video platform team, including the media management console, analytics console, and video player. Work included extensive use of JavaScript (including frameworks and libraries like Ember.js, Handlebars.js, Twitter Bootstrap, and jQuery), ActionScript (including the Flex framework), and when required a few lines of PHP, Java, and Ruby. These components communicated with internal web services via REST and SOAP APIs.

The start-up experience was invaluable, and included working hands-on (and many late nights and weekends) on many different aspects of the software development and release process. Including everything from sketching basic wire frame ideas with the product director, creating simple icons when no designer was on the team, to developing the code, then completing deployment processes (initially rudimentary build processes that involved SSHing into appropriate boxes, configuring and restarting Apache and then more proper workflows including work with tools such as Chef, Webistrano, Hudson / Jenkins).

Comfortable use of a variety of source control and build tools, such as Git, SVN, Maven, npm, Grunt, and Artifactory.

Used documented APIs and third-party libraries to integrate with a variety of analytics services and advertisement platforms, including Google Analytics, Omniture, DoubleClick, YuMe, and others.

Handled typical frontend hurdles such as localization, paging, sub-accounts, and permissions.

Acted as Scrum Master for several Sprints and practiced Agile methodologies. Participated in code reviews and mentored other employees as needed.

Programming Language: C#, ASP.NET, Silverlight & SQL Server 2005

- Developed a solution to continuously integrate code across multiple software branches. Main aim of solution was to reduce amount of time developer spend integrating code and interacting with various test and build system. Solution achieved this by first identify code dependency across many software branches in form of occlusion graph, by maximizing automation of non-occluding code changes and by engaging a developer only if pre-defined scenarios occurred. I wrote and unit tested Framework to interact with revision control system (Perforce), developed windows service which interacted with various build and test system to concurrently integrate code changes and worked on SQL queries to dynamically generate occlusion graph.
- Redesigned, developed and tested a scalable and multi-threaded windows service in C# to continuously monitor and report code difference between various development branches. Service provided a 5X improvement over old solution and was better scalable.

In addition, I helped build and maintain an internal tool that allows our digital asset artists to rapidly view, QA, and iterate on their creations and deploy the assets directly to our clients. I've worked on the scripts to automatically create VMs for developers or deploy the software to production using Vagrant and Ansible. I'm knowledgable of AWS - particularly EC2, S3, ElastiCache, and SQS which are used in Ditto's stack.

As part of my team lead role, I've helped orchestrate software releases to our clients to ensure that the deploy goes smoothly and to provide support to our DevOps team.

Over the coming months and years we will bring to market technologies and advanced analytic services that tackle emerging healthcare challenges such as population health and mechanisms to better care for healthcare consumers before and after they visit the hospital. This will require innovative new technology as well as significant cooperation between payers, providers and halo organizations that offer intervention services to the industry.
While there are more than a handful of companies in the market with similar missions, we've got a good hunch (and reams of research) to suggest that there's considerable room to do a lot better. As we demonstrate this to be the case it's my sincerest hope that we'll have the opportunity to positively impact the lives of friends, colleagues and loved ones around the world.

Northwestern Mutual views the recruiting and selection of financial advisors as a mutual selection process. The office evaluates a candidate's potential for success as a financial advisor. At the same time, the candidate evaluates the office's ability to support each individual's professional and financial goals. When everything aligns, you have a ""mutual fit.""

Security for decades has been about securing the perimeter around data. Instead, we focus on protecting the data itself across its entire lifecycle at enterprise scale by creating a system of record for contextually defining and enforcing rich data access policies.
The fundamental issue is that data security is siloed, but sensitive data is not. Until this problem is solved with consistency, apps and data are at risk, and innovation is stalled. This is data security gridlock.
Machina™ is our data protection engine for managing all types of data throughout its lifecycle. Data handling policies are globally expressed and managed from a single control plane, across all your applications, repositories, and workloads -- regardless of where they live or operate.

They gave us free pizza's for internal events and give free pizza during our vendor fairs. We also recieved 5,000 tshirts with The Lorenzo and Blaze Pizza logo sponsored by them.

We created a unique network of hundreds of vetted ""Expert Patients"" and thousands of health bloggers to create highly-targetted, highest quality health content, answer questions and drive ""conversation."" We acquired and developed a sophisticated capability to match long tail health search queries to specific relevant engagements and information for our users, and drive more relevant content.

In addition, HealthCentral remains a central resource and voice for patients, think tanks, health industry and government regulators considering ways for technology to make healthier lives. We have won numerous interactive and health industry awards.

The company integrated five acquisitions, grew to over 15 million monthly unique users, and had double digit compounded growth in revenue. We were a Deloitte and Inc. fastest growing company.

We maintained an independent interactive sales team, whose revenue growth compounded in the high double digits over this time. We negotiated a hosting agreement for Newsweek on MSNBC, and countless distribution and content partners, being among the first publishing integrations with Google. We worked closely with and daily leveraged the traditional editorial and business operations, quality and expertise.

Taking over the company as a direct dial data service (as was Lexus Nexus and West at the time), our team faced significant challenges in the rise of the browser and by the United States government for the first time putting legislative and regulatory information online for free. The Company was a ""start-up/turn around"" in that it quickly had to migrate as an online service, utilizing new capabilities and design, while also retooling its operations to accomodate this change, stem significant revenue challenges and cash burn.

In two years, we replaced almost two-thirds of the 150 employees (after cuts); restructured our pricing and marketing strategy; initiated significant customer-service focus efforts (including replacing an answeingr machine with a first class phone system so customers could reach a human 24 hours a day); launch the first online capabilities; acquired a content and research service focused on State legislation and regulation and integrate its North Carolina assets to Washington DC.

Our team turned in double digit revenue growth in our second year after three years of declines and broke even.
