A pioneer in the large-format, luxury short term rental space, Heirloom prides itself on defining and redefining industry standards.  ABOUT HEIRLOOM  Daniel and Frank Glaser started Heirloom because they were dissatisfied with the typical short-term home rental experience. They wanted guests to enjoy consistent, high-quality home rentals that feel connected to the local culture and community and offer ample space to come together as a group.  They found the only way to guarantee this level of guest satisfaction was to manage and renovate each home to their exacting standards. By hiring local support teams to make sure travelers are genuinely connected to the cities they want to explore, they could provide a travel experience that cannot be replicated by the anonymous hotel industry.  When they purchased their first homes in Boston and New Orleans, Frank and Dan used family heirlooms to fill the home. These pieces were full of history and meaning. This allowed the creation of something that cannot be ordered online or mass produced. And thus, Heirloom was born.  Now operating with 100+ properties in major travel destinations such as New York, New Orleans, Austin, and Boston, Heirloom is well on its way to accomplishing its mission: ensuring that every guest has a world-class hospitality experience worth sharing.

Recent surveys have shown a majority of corporations experience a material impact from FX, and even the largest firms are not immune (in 2013, Wal-Mart, Samsung and GM all had material losses due to foreign exchange.)  It is not surprising why. It can be difficult to calculate accurate FX exposures from corporate accounting and ERP systems. Poor FX policies and strategies lead to volatile and difficult-to-explain hedging results, and pricing of FX derivatives is opaque. For companies without the requisite expertise, the job can be overwhelming.  Currency Risk Management is here to help small to mid-sized enterprises with FX Risk management.
